**Frontend notes:**
setup instructions:
```
- I have uploaded all the files here that you may need to start working on the project.
- Follow the tutorial till the tailwind css setup is complete and you can see the Hello World Text.
- Then copy paste all the files here into your project.
- If the  file is not on this page it means it is safe to remove it from the project.
- Some boilerplate filler text is given for each page to assist navigation.
- Please delete all the deleteme.html files once you download the repository.
```

**Backend notes:**
- we will be using supabase as a websocket to store the user accounts, real-time chat interactions and reviews
- refer to `.env` file for secret key information.
